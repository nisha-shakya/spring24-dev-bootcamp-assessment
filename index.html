                <p>I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at Georgia Tech with threads in Information Internetworks and People. It's nice to meet you!
                </p>
                <p>I'm passionate about using technology to address mental health issues and support individuals with disabilities.</p>

                <h1>More About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    In my UI design course, my professor shared her research on designing a social network to support young adults with autism. 
                    This resonated with me because I think technology  has the power to make environments more accessible, 
                    inclusive, and supportive for people with mental health conditions and disabilities.</p>
                <p>In Bits of Good, I would like to help create meaningful projects that use technology for social good. While
                    I am new to web dev, I'm excited about the opportunity to learn more and put my skills to work.
